# my-ninth-assignment / NoAhGrAm

Deployed On Vercel - https://my-eigth-assignment.vercel.app/

I managed to achieve mainly everything, aside from the /user/[userId] however I think I managed to achieve everything else. I managed to get the comments to display on the page, and for you to be able to comment on the things on the page. I didn't manage to add the /user/[userid] but I feel as though I added it elsewhere. I believe I did well with the CSS, but I feel as though I could have added some media to it, to make it neater on the phone. I did encounter a few bugs but they turned out to be spelling mistakes or I missed a word so they were quite easily sorted.
